# Spring Boot Demo Project

This is a demonstration project for learning and experimenting with Spring Boot. The project covers key aspects of building a Spring Boot application, including database setup, JPA modeling, and creating RESTful APIs.

## Features

1. **Setting up the Database**  
   Configure and initialize the database for the application.

2. **Connecting the Database**  
   Establish a connection between the Spring Boot application and the database (e.g., MySQL).

3. **Creating the JPA Models**  
   Define entity classes to represent the database tables.

4. **Working with JPA Relationships**  
   Implement one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships between entities.

5. **Working with Binary Data Types**  
   Handle and store binary data (e.g., images, files) in the database.

6. **Creating JPA Repositories**  
   Create repositories for data access and query execution using Spring Data JPA.

7. **Creating Spring API Rest Controllers**  
   Develop RESTful endpoints to interact with the application.

8. **Handling Serialization Issues**  
   Address common serialization problems, such as cyclic dependencies, using tools like `@JsonIgnore` and `@JsonManagedReference`.

## Prerequisites

- Java 17
- Tools: Maven, Postman
- Database: MySQL, JPA
- IDE: IntelliJ

Happy coding!
